<h2>What is a Convolutional Neural Network?</h2>

<p>
    Before we tell you what it is, think about how you are seeing this webpage
    right now. How does your brain know what a computer or a website look like?
    Well its because you have <strong>learned</strong> (since your youth) what
    a computer is. You also know that a your smartphone and a piece of
    rectangular cardboard (of roughly the same shape) are two distinct objects.
    But naively, you can think of them as having dimensions and are therefore
    the same. To an extreme, you also managed to learn nuanced differences; say
    between an <strong>Android phone</strong> and an <strong>iPhone</strong>
    even though they are quite similar sometimes.
</p>

<p>
    Convolutional neural networks are a form of <strong>machine
    learning</strong> meaning that the computers are fed LOTS of data and, over
    time, learn how to discriminate between images, sounds, DNA or just about
    any data you can think about. With the cheap cost of computational power of
    graphical processing units nowadays (thanks, gamers!), we can afford to
    build very complex models which are increasingly better than traditional
    machine learning models.
</p>

<p>
    Convolutional neural networks uses a bunch of filters (think Instagram!)
    which allows it to easily detect corners and edges in an image. Not only
    that; deep in the network the neural network can detect entire faces by
    combining filters heirarchically. It's like pieceing a very large puzzle
    from very small pieces and then guessing what that puzzle is. What kinds of
    filters do we need to select for the neural network? Nothing! In fact, the
    convolutional neural network will learn these filters as they go along,
    making it the <strong>best</strong> filter to be able to classify whatever
    image it was trained to see.

<h2>How was this made?</h2>
<p>
    We scraped some images of fashionable items from the UAE Souq.com website
    and trained a convolutional neural network. The libraries we used include
    <strong>Keras</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and a lot of GPU power.
    This web application is made using <strong>Flask</strong> and
    <strong>Python</strong>.
